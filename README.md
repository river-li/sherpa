## 🎯 Impact: Real Bugs in Production Software

<div align="center">

| 💥 **Raw Crashes Found** | 🔍 **Auto-Filtered** | ✅ **Validated CVE-Class Bugs** | 🎯 **Precision Rate** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **127+** | **100+** | **18** | **67%** |

</div>

**What makes this significant:**
* 🎯 **Targeted Discovery**: 18 validated bugs from just 27 high-signal crashes (vs. typical fuzzing's 1-5% success rate)
* 🚀 **Speed**: Minutes of targeted fuzzing vs. weeks of traditional coverage-guided fuzzing
* 🔍 **Quality**: LLM crash analysis automatically filters 80% of false positives before human review
* 📦 **Production Ready**: Every bug comes with reproducer, analysis, and patch guidance
* 🔒 **Responsible Process**: Bugs are disclosed responsibly to maintainers with coordinated timelines

<td width="60%">

**The Problem:** Traditional fuzzing targets low-level APIs that attackers rarely reach directly. Real exploits happen at high-level parsers processing attacker-controlled files, packets, and streams.

**SHERPA's Solution:** An LLM pipeline that automatically identifies and generates fuzz harnesses for these high-value, attacker-controlled entry points in OSS-Fuzz projects—the exact functions that parse malicious PDFs, process network packets, and handle file uploads.

**🚀 Key Innovation:** Moving fuzzing *up the stack* to where real attacks happen, with LLM agents that understand security impact and generate maintainer-ready artifacts.

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **📊 Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify unfuzzed, attacker-controlled entry points
2. **🤖 LLM Harness Generation**: Generate targeted fuzz harnesses using LLM agents  
3. **🔨 Build-Until-Green**: Automatically fix compilation and build issues
4. **🎯 Targeted Fuzzing**: Run focused fuzzing campaigns on new harnesses
5. **🧠 LLM Crash Triage**: Automatically filter false positives and analyze crashes
6. **📋 Maintainer Artifacts**: Deliver actionable bug reports with repro steps

Through these techniques we were able to produce **new harnesses** as well as **corresponding crashing fuzzer inputs**. Each auto‑produced crash is summarized below.

# Automatically Produced Crashes

**📋 Responsible Disclosure Note**

We provide a detailed [LevelDB case study](leveldb_writeup/workflow.md) as a complete example of SHERPA's methodology. The remaining 17 validated bugs are currently undergoing responsible disclosure with their respective maintainers. Full technical details and attribution to SHERPA will be published upon completion of the disclosure process, ensuring maintainers have adequate time to develop and deploy patches.

## False Positives & Quality Control

We encountered **>100 raw false positives** (e.g., harness errors, misuse of library APIs, or practically unreachable conditions). These were **automatically triaged** by an LLM crash‑analysis agent and **excluded** from the *Automatically Produced Crashes* table. The remaining items were then **manually triaged** to produce the *Validated Bugs* table above.

**How we mitigate false positives (two layers):**

1. **Ex‑ante safeguards in the harness‑generator prompt**
   The generator is instructed to:

   * Target **public/documented APIs** and **high‑level parsers** that ingest attacker‑controlled inputs.
   * **Mirror canonical initialization** and teardown patterns from project examples.
   * **Honor documented preconditions** (sizes, flags, state); avoid undefined behavior and unrealistic call sequences.
   * Prefer **file/stream entry points** and add a small, meaningful seed corpus.
   * Compile with sanitizers and ensure resource hygiene (close files, free objects).

2. **Ex‑post LLM crash analysis (automatic triage)**
   For each crash, the agent:

   * Parses sanitizer logs and **attributes the fault** to project/library vs. harness code.
   * Detects **harness anti‑patterns** (calling private/internal functions, skipping required init, invalid lifetimes, wrong buffer sizes/flags).
   * Labels likely non‑bugs as false-positives and filters them out.
   * Produces `crash_analysis.md` with root cause, impact, and patch guidance for retained findings.

This two‑stage process yields a **high‑signal set** of auto‑produced crashes (first table), which then undergo **human validation** (second table) to confirm exploitability and practical relevance.

## 🚀 Why This Changes Everything

**Traditional fuzzing finds bugs that attackers can't reach. SHERPA finds bugs that attackers exploit.**

### **The Fundamental Problem**
Current fuzzing tools excel at hitting internal parsing functions, but attackers don't call `parse_header_field()` directly. They upload malicious PDFs, send crafted network packets, or submit malformed form data. There's a massive gap between what we fuzz and what attackers actually hit.

### **SHERPA's Paradigm Shift**

| Traditional Approach | SHERPA Approach |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 🎯 **Target**: Low-level internal APIs | 🎯 **Target**: Attacker-controlled entry points |
| ⏱️ **Speed**: Weeks of coverage-guided fuzzing | ⏱️ **Speed**: Minutes of targeted fuzzing |
| 🎲 **Success**: 1-5% of crashes are real bugs | 🎲 **Success**: 67% precision rate |
| 👨‍💻 **Triage**: Manual analysis of 100+ crashes | 👨‍💻 **Triage**: AI pre-filters to 18 validated bugs |
| 📋 **Output**: Raw crash dumps | 📋 **Output**: CVE-ready reports with patches |

### **Real-World Impact**
- **Security Teams**: Find exploitable bugs, not just fuzzing artifacts
- **OSS Maintainers**: Receive actionable reports with reproduction steps and patch guidance  
- **Red Teams**: Discover attack surfaces that traditional tools miss
- **Researchers**: Scale expert-level security analysis using LLM reasoning

**Bottom Line**: We're not just improving fuzzing efficiency—we're changing what gets fuzzed to match real attack patterns.

## 🤖 LLM Architecture & AI Integration

### **Model Selection & Configuration**
- **Primary Model**: OpenAI o3 (latest reasoning model) for complex code generation and analysis
- **Fallback Model**: o4-mini for lighter tasks like report generation  
- **API Integration**: Standard OpenAI-compatible endpoints with robust retry logic
- **Execution Environment**: Custom `CodexHelper` wrapper with pseudo-terminal integration

### **Multi-Stage AI Pipeline**

**Stage 1: Intelligent Target Selection**
- Analyzes OSS-Fuzz project structure and existing harnesses
- Identifies high-value, unfuzzed entry points using security heuristics
- Prioritizes public APIs that process attacker-controlled data

**Stage 2: Context-Aware Harness Generation**  
- Clones target repositories for API signature validation
- Generates libFuzzer harnesses with proper library initialization
- Includes realistic setup patterns to prevent false positives

**Stage 3: Automated Build Debugging**
- Captures compiler errors and automatically generates minimal fixes
- Iterative build-fix cycles (configurable retry limit)
- Preserves project structure while ensuring compilation success

**Stage 4: Semantic Corpus Generation**
- Creates meaningful seed inputs based on harness analysis
- Generates both text and binary test cases as appropriate
- Focuses on edge cases and boundary conditions

**Stage 5: Intelligent Crash Triage**
- Distinguishes genuine bugs from harness implementation errors
- Uses sentinel patterns (`HARNESS ERROR`) for automatic filtering
- Performs root cause analysis with impact assessment

### **Key Prompt Engineering Innovations**

1. **Security-First Target Selection**: AI agents prioritize real attack surfaces over internal APIs
2. **Anti-False-Positive Design**: Built-in validation prevents common harness implementation errors
3. **Automated Quality Control**: Two-layer filtering (prompt guidance + post-crash analysis)
4. **Maintainer-Ready Output**: Structured reports with CWE mapping and actionable patch guidance

### **Technical Implementation Details**

```python
# Core architecture components
class HarnessGenerator:
    def _invoke_codex_for_harness(self) -> None:
        # Targets highest-level APIs with attacker-controlled input
        # Validates function signatures against cloned repositories
        # Ensures realistic library usage patterns
        
    def _generate_bug_report(self) -> None:
        # Analyzes crashes for genuine vs. harness-induced bugs
        # Generates CVE-ready reports with impact assessment
        # Creates reproduction scripts for maintainers
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for API failures
- **Git Integration**: Tracks changes and ensures clean diffs for each AI intervention
- **Resource Management**: Configurable timeouts and memory limits for long-running operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent harness generation across multiple projects

**Full implementation details available in source code under GPL v3 license.**
